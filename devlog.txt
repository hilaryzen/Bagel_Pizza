- Added initial design doc and structure to the repo

- Updated the front-end framework of our design doc to show that the website will have multiple pages
- Added more functionality (pie charts that break down world CO2 emissions by country) for the later deadline
- Included another idea, graphs for each country's CO2 emissions, if we have extra time

- Added boostrap to the base and the home page
- Expected by tonight to finish preliminary design and start working on d3

- Finished Carbon Emissions graphs, just need the CSV reader function to get the ranges working
- Trying to implement a highlight and zoom function for the line graph
- Soon will start work on comparison graphs

- Added CSV reader function for global CO2 Emissions into main python file
- CSV reader function and possibly assist functions still in progress for singular country CO2 emissions
- Planning on creating separate python file for assist functions solely

- Added two side by side graphs in the Comparison page with cool functionalities 
- A few things must be fixed: X-axes for both graphs, y-axis for temperature graph
- Will add an option for the user to combine the two graphs
- In carbon.html, must also fix the axis and hopefully get the brushing to work
- To-do: add descriptions for graphs, proper labels, and short instructions on how to interact with the graphs

- Fixed all the axes for the carbon emissions graphs and the comparison graphs !!!!! YAY
- Carbon Graphs DONE! Brushing, Selection, ALL WORKS!!!!!
- Added small instructions for the carbon graphs, might add some more detailed ones
- Still need to work on the merged graphs, it's kinda strange figuring out the axes
- Will start looking into pie charts, as an extra thing for the carbon graphs
