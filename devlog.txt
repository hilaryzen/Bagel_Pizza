- Added initial design doc and structure to the repo

hilaryZ -- 2020-04-29 22:48
- Updated the front-end framework of our design doc to show that the website will have multiple pages
- Added more functionality (pie charts that break down world CO2 emissions by country) for the later deadline
- Included another idea, graphs for each country's CO2 emissions, if we have extra time

aliceN -- 2020-05-1 13:58
- Added boostrap to the base and the home page
- Expected by tonight to finish preliminary design and start working on d3

aliceN -- 2020-05-06 13:29
- Finished Carbon Emissions graphs, just need the CSV reader function to get the ranges working
- Trying to implement a highlight and zoom function for the line graph
- Soon will start work on comparison graphs

leiaP -- 2020-05-06 14:21
- Added CSV reader function for global CO2 Emissions into main python file
- CSV reader function and possibly assist functions still in progress for singular country CO2 emissions
- Planning on creating separate python file for assist functions solely

aliceN -- 2020-05-07 00:01
- Added two side by side graphs in the Comparison page with cool functionalities 
- A few things must be fixed: X-axes for both graphs, y-axis for temperature graph
- Will add an option for the user to combine the two graphs
- In carbon.html, must also fix the axis and hopefully get the brushing to work
- To-do: add descriptions for graphs, proper labels, and short instructions on how to interact with the graphs

aliceN -- 2020-05-08 00:10
- Fixed all the axes for the carbon emissions graphs and the comparison graphs !!!!! YAY
- Carbon Graphs DONE! Brushing, Selection, ALL WORKS!!!!!
- Added small instructions for the carbon graphs, might add some more detailed ones
- Still need to work on the merged graphs, it's kinda strange figuring out the axes
- Will start looking into pie charts, as an extra thing for the carbon graphs

aliceN -- 2020-05-08 23:58
- Added some design changes to make the site look nicer
- A merged graph exists, but it looks weird. Gonna look into other types of graphs for this one.
- If time, make the green scale for the carbon bar chart longer so there are more colors.

leiaP -- 2020-05-09 15:29
- Added the CSV reader function to create dictionary of countries and their CO2 emissions
- Planning on editing design doc to update: data.py helper file is no longer necessary

aliceN -- 2020-05-10 01:03
- Finalized the comparsion graphs, added another one for U.S vs Global temperature anomaly
- Added some design, like tooltips for the dots and some description
- Tomorrow (or today oops) will look into another possible type of graph to add, some extras
- Will also finalize design of the site, like remove search bar, etc. 

leiaP -- 2020-05-10 17:22
- Added another CSV reader function to create dictionary of countries based on year
- Refresh:
  - First country CSV reader makes dict of countries with co2 emission of each year
  - ex. dict = {"UNITED STATES" : {1901: ###, 1902: ###}, "UNITED KINGDOM": {1901:###, ....}}
  - Second country csv reader makes dict of years with co2 emission of each country
  - ex. dict = {1901: {"PERU" : ####, "GREECE": ####], 1902: {"PERU": ###, ...}}
- Added in carbon.html code to create pie chart for each country -- still in progress

aliceN -- 2020-05-11 02:03
- Added one final graph to compare graphs page! Allows user to toggle between countries.
- Finalized the design of the site, and added an enlightenment button

aliceN -- 2020-05-11 02:11
- Edited the design doc so it accurately describes what each page of the site contains
- Removed files we ended up not using: data.py, data.js

aliceN -- 2020-05-11 18:44
- Added the pie chart to the carbon emissions page. Hover functionality working.
- Fixed minor dot problem for compare data page
